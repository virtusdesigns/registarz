							<p>Welcome to Registarz. Registarz, Inc. ("Registarz", "we", "us" and/or "our") enables people all over the world to plan, promote, and sell registrations and tickets to any event. We do this through our website and domain, the services available on or through our website and domain or otherwise provided by us, and the software available on or through our website and domain or otherwise provided by us (collectively, the "Services").</p>
							<p><b>Our Policy:</b></p>
							<p>This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable information ("Personal Data"), that is collected from users of and/or visitors to the Services (including through those users' and visitors' agents) ("you" or "your"), including (i) registered users who are event organizers, planners and charitable organizations ("Organizers"), (ii) users who want to purchase tickets to, register for or donate to events (whether free or paid) listed by Organizers on the Services ("Buyers"), and (iii) other non-Organizer users or visitors to the Services ("other non-Organizers").</p>
							<p>We take the privacy of your Personal Data and other information seriously. Because of that, we have created this Privacy Policy. Please read this Privacy Policy as it includes important information regarding your Personal Data and other information.</p>
							<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
							<p><b>Consent:</b></p>
							<p><b>By using the Services or allowing someone to use the Services on your behalf, you are consenting to our collection, use, disclosure, transfer and storage in accordance with this Privacy Policy of any Personal Data or other information received by us as a result of such use.</b></p>
							<p>Information We Collect:</p>
							<p>When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>
							<p><b>1. Personal Data:</b></p>
							<p>Organizers:&nbsp;We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information to the Services, such as when you register for access to the Services as an Organizer, contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys or use certain Services. The Personal Data we may collect includes without limitation your name, address, email address and other personally identifiable information. In some cases we may collect your credit card information (e.g., your credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.), some of which may constitute Personal Data, to secure certain payments. In addition, if you use our payment processing services, we will collect financial information from you (e.g., your bank account information or an address to send checks) as necessary to facilitate payments.</p>
							<p>Buyers and other non-Organizers:&nbsp;We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information to the Services (including event registration pages within the Services), such as when you register for access to the Services (whether as an Organizer or otherwise), register for an event as a Buyer, contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys or use certain parts of the Services. The Personal Data we may collect includes without limitation your name, address, email address, zip code and other personally identifiable information. If you register for a paid event, we will collect financial information from you (e.g., your credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.) some of which may constitute Personal Data. In addition, Organizers can set up event registration pages to collect virtually any information from Buyers in connection with registration for an Organizer's event listed on the Services. If a Buyer voluntarily provides that information in connection with registration for an event or otherwise, it will be available to us and will be held by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition, such information will be delivered to the Organizer of the applicable event in accordance with "Our Disclosure of Information That We Collect: Organizers" below.</p>
							<p>Privacy Policy Links:&nbsp;We make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy in the footer of every page on our website, including those pages on which Personal Data is collected, and to make it available in all of our software.</p>
							<p><b>2. Non-Personal Data:</b></p>
							<p>Non-Identifiable Data:&nbsp;When you interact with the Services, we collect certain personally non-identifiable information ("Non-Personal Data"). The Non-Personal Data we collect includes without limitation Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, Internet browser type, other characteristics of your device and software, domain names of your Internet Service Provider, your approximate geographic location, a record of your usage of the Services, the time of your usage and aggregated Personal Data that cannot be used to specifically identify you. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot, in and of itself, be used to specifically identify you. We also collect Non-Personal Data (including, without limitation, of the type set forth above) from third parties. The information we collect from third parties may be combined with the information we collect.</p>
							<p>Aggregated Personal Data:&nbsp;In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, we often conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data and other information that we have collected. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis and this aggregate information does not identify you personally and therefore is considered and treated as Non-Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.</p>
							<p>Our Use of Information That We Collect:<br><b>1. Personal Data:</b></p>
							<p>We use the Personal Data we collect in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may use the Personal Data as follows:</p>
							<ul><li>Specific Reason:&nbsp;If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem and will respond to the email address from which the contact came.</li>
							<li>Access and Use:&nbsp;If you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to or use of the Services or any functionality thereof, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to or use of the Services or functionality and to monitor your use of such Services or functionality. For instance, if you supply payment information (e.g., bank account or credit card information) to the Services for the purpose of purchasing tickets as a Buyer or processing payments as an Organizer, we will use that information to facilitate such purchase or process such payments.</li>
							<li>Internal Business Purposes:&nbsp;We may use your Personal Data for internal business purposes including without limitation to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users, to improve the Services, to protect against, identify or address wrongdoing, to enforce our Terms of Service, to manage your account and provide you with customer service, and to generally manage the Services and our business.</li>
							<li>Marketing:&nbsp;We may use your Personal Data to contact you in the future for our marketing and advertising purposes, including without limitation to inform you about services or events we believe might be of interest to you, to develop promotional or marketing materials and provide those materials to you, and to display content and advertising on or off the Services that we believe might be of relevance to you. In particular, Organizers should note that we may use information we receive or collect regarding Buyers (including without limitation via an Organizer's event registration page) in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, including in the manner set forth above.</li>
							<li>Organizer Emails:&nbsp;We allow Organizers to use our system to contact Buyers for their current and past events, so you may receive emails from such Organizers. </li>
							</ul><p>If we intend to use any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected or we will obtain your consent subsequent to such collection but prior to such use.</p>
							<p><b>2. Non-Personal Data:</b></p>
							<p>Because Non-Personal Data cannot be used to personally identify you, we may use such information for any lawful purpose.</p>
							<p>Our Disclosure of Information That We Collect:</p>
							<p><b>1. Personal Data:</b></p>
							<p>We are not in the business of selling your Personal Data. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. Therefore, we will not sell your Personal Data to third parties, including third party advertisers. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may disclose, transfer or share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>
							<p>Business Transfers:&nbsp;As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets. You acknowledge and agree that any successor to or acquirer of Registarz (or its assets) will continue to have the right to use your Personal Data and other information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
							<p>Subsidiaries and Affiliates:&nbsp;We may also share your Personal Data with our subsidiaries and/or affiliates for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. Our subsidiaries and affiliates will be bound to maintain that Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>
							Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:&nbsp;We, like many businesses, sometimes engage other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, ticket fulfillment, fraud prevention, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we engage another company to perform such functions, we may provide them with information, including Personal Data, in connection with their performance of such functions.</p>
							<p>Organizers:&nbsp;When you purchase tickets to, register for or donate to an event or related fundraising page on the Services, you consent to our providing your Personal Data to the Organizers of such event and related fundraising page, if applicable. For fundraising pages we may provide your personal information both to the Organizer charity of the fundraising page and the Organizer of the event to which the fundraising page is linked. These Organizers are not bound to treat your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You agree that we are not responsible for the actions of these Organizers with respect to your Personal Data. It is important that you review the applicable policies of the Organizers of an event (and the related fundraising page, if applicable) before providing Personal Data or other information in connection with that event or related fundraising page.</p>
							<p>Legal Requirements:&nbsp;We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law (including, without limitation responding to a subpoena or request from law enforcement, court or government agency) or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary (i) to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect or defend our rights, interests or property or that of third parties, (iii) to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Services, (iv) to act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (v) to protect against legal liability.</p>
							<p><b>2. Non-Personal Data:</b></p>
							<p>Because Non-Personal Data cannot be used to personally identify you, we may disclose, transfer or share Non-Personal Data for any lawful purpose.</p>
							<p>Your Choices:</p>
							<p>You have several choices available when it comes to your Personal Data:</p>
							<p>Limit the Personal Data You Provide:&nbsp;You can use the Services without providing any Personal Data or with limiting the Personal Data you provide. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data or limit the Personal Data you provide, you may not be able to use certain functionality of the Services. For instance, in order to open an account, or buy or sell tickets, your name and email address will be required.</p>
							<p>Do Not Track:&nbsp;We currently do not participate in any "Do Not Track" frameworks that would allow us to respond to signals or other mechanisms from you regarding the collection of your Personal Data.</p>
							<p><b>Exclusions:</b></p>
							<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by us other than Personal Data collected through the Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us or another user or visitor through the Services or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Services, such as bulletin boards, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, claim or demand letters, Digital Millennium Copyright Act notices, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation or attribution.</p>
							<p><b>Storage and Security:</b></p>
							<p>We may store Personal Data itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by our affiliates, agents or service providers. We take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, inadvertent disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data via the Internet.</p>
							<p><b>International Privacy Laws:</b></p>
							<p>If you are visiting our website or using one of our software applications from outside the United States, please be aware that you are sending information (including Personal Data) to the United States where our servers are located. We will hold and process your Personal Data and Non-Personal Data in accordance with privacy laws in the United States and this Privacy Policy. Please note that privacy laws in the United States may not be the same as, and in some cases may be less protective than, the privacy laws in your country.</p>
							<p><b>Changes to This Privacy Policy:</b></p>
							<p>The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time (collectively, "Modifications"). Modifications to this Privacy Policy will be posted to the Registarz website with a change to the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. In certain circumstances Registarz may, but need not, provide you with additional notice of such Modifications, such as via email or with in-Service notifications. Modifications will be effective 30 days following the "Last Updated" date or such other date as communicated in any other notice to you. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services following the effectiveness of any Modifications to this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of those Modifications. If any Modification to this Privacy Policy is not acceptable to you, your sole remedy is to cease accessing, browsing and otherwise using the Services.</p>
							<p><b>Access to Information:</b></p>
							<p>Organizers may access and update their Personal Data being stored by us by logging in and visiting the My Account page. Organizers may also contact us directly at the address specified below with respect to Personal Data that is not accessible through the My Account page. Buyers and other non-Organizers do not have a formal account with Registarz, however, you can create a formal account by signing up. After signing up, you can update and access your Personal Data on the My Account page. Buyers and other non-Organizers can also contact us directly with requests to update Personal Data at the address specified below. We will take reasonable steps to respond to requests relating to Personal Data within 30 days, however, we may reject requests that we find to be unreasonable (i.e., require disproportionate efforts or material changes to our information systems), impractical or abusive (i.e., repetitive requests, requests made in bad faith, requests that would compromise third party information). Note that you may not have access to or the ability to update Non-Personal Data, much of which is held in aggregate form.</p>
							<p><b>Retention and Deletion:</b></p>
							<p>We may retain your Personal Data as long as you continue to use the Services. You may close your account by contacting us. However, we may retain Personal Data and Non-Personal Data for an additional period as is permitted or required under applicable laws.

The English language version of each of these documents is the version that governs your use of the Services and in the event of any conflict between the English language version and a translated version, the English language version will control.</p>
							<p>2. DESCRIPTION OF REGISTARZ.</p>
							<p>REGISTARZ provides a simple and quick means for registered users who are event organizers and planners ("Organizers") to collect payments with respect to the sale of tickets/registrations to events registered on the Site from users who want to attend such events ("Buyers" or "you"). Organizers may visit the Site, fill out a questionnaire about their event, including pricing, location, inventory, etc., and collect event registration fees online directly from Buyers. Payments are all transacted through Authorize.net or other third party payment service methods (collectively, "Facilitated Payment Modes" or "FPM"). For more information, please see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.registarz.com">https://www.registarz.com</a>. This TOS applies to you and your use of the Services as a Buyer and/or other non-Organizer user or visitor of the Services ("non-Organizer" or "you").</p>
							<p>3. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>
							<p><b>3.1 The Services.</b></p>
							<p>Registarz hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right to access and use the Services solely for the purposes of browsing the Site, and searching for, viewing, registering for, and interacting with, an event that is registered on the Site, in each case (i) in compliance with this TOS, and (ii) to the extent permitted under all applicable laws and regulations (foreign and domestic). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not, and shall not permit anyone else to, directly or indirectly: (i) modify, reproduce or otherwise create derivatives of any part of the Services or Site Content (as defined below); (ii) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or structure, sequence and organization of all or any part of the Services (except that this restriction shall not apply to the limited extent restrictions on reverse engineering are prohibited by applicable local law); (iii) rent, lease, resell, distribute or use the Services for timesharing, service bureau, or commercial purposes; (iv) remove or alter any proprietary notices or labels on or in the Services or Site Content; (v) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services; or (vi) engage in any fraudulent activity or activity that facilitates fraud.</p>
							<p>4. PAYMENT.</p>
							<p><b>4.1 Independent Relationship of FPMs.</b></p>
							<p>When using a FPM, Organizers and Buyers effect the applicable monetary payment transaction through the FPM service, and are bound by the applicable terms of use governing the FPM service.</p>
							<p><b>4.2 Refunds.</b></p>
							<p>t is the responsibility of the Organizer to communicate its refund policy to Buyers and to issue refunds to Buyers via the Site or otherwise. If a Buyer desires to request a refund, Buyer must request the refund from the Organizer. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Organizer and Buyer and Registarz will not be responsible or liable in any way for refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the Services. All communications and disputes regarding chargebacks and refunds are between the Organizer and Buyer and Registarz will not be responsible or liable in any way for chargebacks in connection with a Buyer's use of the Services. If you are a Buyer and you wish to request a refund in connection with an event listed on the Services, you should contact the applicable Organizer directly.</p>
							<p>5. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS.</p>

If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Registarz has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Registarz has the right to suspend or terminate all of your accounts and refuse any and all of your current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof). Registarz is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users, particularly children. For this reason, and to be consistent with the terms of use of any FPM service provider or other third party service provider, you must be at least 18 years of age, or the legal age of majority where you reside if that jurisdiction has an older age of majority, to register for an account.</p>
							<p>6. ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY.</p>
							<p>As part of the Site registration process, you will create a password and account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account, including, without limitation, all actions by sub-users registered under your account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Registarz of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. Registraz cannot and will not be liable for any loss, damage or other liability arising from your failure to comply with this Section or from any unauthorized access to or use of your account. In the event of any dispute between two or more parties as to account ownership, you agree that Registarz shall be the sole arbiter of such dispute in its sole discretion and that Registarz's decision (which may include termination or suspension of any account subject to dispute) shall be final and binding on all parties.</p>
							<p>7. CONTENT.<br><b>7.1 Site Content.</b></p>

Reproducing, copying or distributing any Site Content for any other purpose is strictly prohibited without the express prior written permission of Registarz. You shall use the Site Content only for purposes that are permitted by this TOS and any applicable laws and regulations (foreign and domestic).

							<p>4. PAYMENT METHODS.</p>
							<p><b>4.1 Overview.</b></p>
							<p>Organizers will have one type of payment option, via "Facilitated Payment Processing" or "FPP", which consists of collecting Event Registration Fees using FPMs. Monetary payments will be made to the Organizer directly by Buyers (via FPP).</p>
							<p><b>4.2 Facilitated Payment Processing.<b></b></b></p>
							<p>(a) Independent Relationship.</p>
							<p>When using a FPM, Organizers and Buyers effect the applicable monetary payment transaction through the FPM service and are bound by the applicable terms of use governing the FPM service.</p>
							<p>(b) Services Fees.</p>
							<p>Organizers will collect all monies directly from Buyers under the FPP option. By registering for and using the FPP option, you agree to (i) pay Registarz all then-applicable Registarz Service Fees and Registarz Payment Processing Fees, which are based on the number of tickets sold by you and/or the value of such tickets, and which charges are described in greater detail at&nbsp;registarz.com, and all additional on-site service fees, equipment lease charges, printed ticket fees, and any other fees and charges of any kind payable by you to REGISTARZ in connection with the provision of the Services (collectively, "Service Fees"), which payments shall be due and payable upon receipt of the invoice setting forth such charges; and (ii) accept the responsibility for providing refunds to Buyers at your own discretion. Registarz will not be responsible or liable for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify Registarz and its affiliates for, refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the use of the FPP option. Invoices are sent monthly for Service Fees incurred in the previous month.</p>
							<p><b>4.3 Registarz Payment Processing.</b></p>
							<p>(a) Authorize.net; Payment Process.</p>
							<p>When an Organizer elects to use the Authorize.net for the collection of Event Registration Fees, payment processing occurs directly through Registarz. Under the CCP option, Registarz will collect all Event Registration Fees on behalf of the Organizer from Buyers and deduct all applicable Services Fees from the Event Registration Fees collected by Registarz, and then pass the remainder along to the Organizer within five (5) business days after the event end date for the event to which the Event Registration Fees correspond (either by mailing a check or through an electronic funds transfer, depending on the option the Organizer has chosen through using the Site, to the address or account, respectively, that the Organizer accurately designates on the Site), provided that Registarz reserves the right to withhold funds (i) at any time as Registarz determines to be necessary for the processing and settlement of all refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks, customer complaints, allegations of fraud, and other discrepancies and (ii) as otherwise permitted pursuant to this TOS. Registarz, in its sole discretion, may determine to advance a portion of Event Registration Fees to Organizer prior to the period set forth above, on such terms and conditions as Registarz may establish from time to time. Organizer agrees that all Event Registration Fees for a given event are earned by Organizer only following conclusion of the applicable event and all Event Registration Fees ultimately due will be net of all Service Fees, refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks and other deductions, whether due to customer complaints, allegations of fraud, discrepancies related to the applicable event or otherwise. No payments shall be made to an Organizer from Registarz with respect to any event that is cancelled. If payments have already been made by Registarz to an Organizer for a cancelled event, such Organizer will immediately refund to Registarz all such payments upon cancellation of such event. All sales, fees, charges, and funds are payable in U.S. Dollars.</p>
							<p>ORGANIZER AGREES THAT ANY PAYMENT BY REGISTARZ OF EVENT REGISTRATION FEES PRIOR TO THE FIFTH (5TH) BUSINESS DAY AFTER THE END DATE OF THE APPLICABLE EVENT ARE MERELY ADVANCES OF AMOUNTS THAT MAY BECOME DUE TO ORGANIZER UNDER THIS TOS AND THAT REGISTARZ MAY DEMAND SUCH ADVANCES BACK (FROM TIME TO TIME IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION), AND ORGANIZER SHALL THEREUPON PROMPTLY (AND IN ANY CASE WITHIN FIVE (5) BUSINESS DAYS AFTER SUCH DEMAND) PAY BACK TO REGISTARZ SUCH ADVANCE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF DEMANDED BY REGISTARZ.</p>
							<p>(b) Refunds.</p>
							<p>(i) Under the CCP option, it is the responsibility of the Organizer to communicate its refund policy to Buyers and to issue refunds to Buyers. An Organizer shall ensure that its refund policy is consistent with the terms of this TOS and the payment and refund mechanics of the Site. All communications or disputes regarding refunds are between the Organizer and Buyer, and Registarz will not be responsible or liable for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify Registarz and its affiliates for, refunds, errors in issuing refunds, or lack of refunds in connection with the use of the CCP option. (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that Registarz shall have the right to force a refund of any or all tickets at any time for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if Registarz receives complaints from a substantial number (as determined by Registarz in its sole discretion) of Buyers with respect to the applicable event or another event held by Organizer, or Registarz determines in its sole discretion that Organizer has engaged in any fraudulent activity or made any misrepresentations. Further, if one or more Buyer(s) request a refund, whether due to a cancelled event or for any other reason where Registarz would reasonably expect to lose a chargeback, Registarz may, in its sole discretion, issue such refund to such Buyer(s), and Organizer shall then owe the amount of such refund to Registarz.</p>
							<p>(c) Credit Card Chargebacks.</p>
							<p>Under the CCP option, any credit card chargebacks initiated by a Buyer for any reason with respect to an event shall be charged back to the Organizer of such event. All communications and disputes regarding chargebacks are between the Organizer and Buyer, and Registarz will not be responsible or liable in any way for, and Organizer hereby agrees to fully indemnify Registarz and its affiliates for, chargebacks issued in the course of the use of the CCP option.</p>
							<p>(d) No Third Party Beneficiary Rights.</p>
							<p>Organizer is not a direct party to any agreement with any Payment Processing Partner or Card Scheme used to process payments in CCP nor is Organizer a third party beneficiary of any such agreement.</p>
							<p><b>4.4 Non-Exclusive Remedies.</b></p>
							<p>(a) Payment.</p>
							<p>In the event that Organizer fails to pay to Registarz any amount owed pursuant to this TOS when due, such amount shall bear interest calculated from the date due until paid in full at a rate equal to the lesser of (a) ten percent (10%) per annum, and (b) the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. In the event any amounts are owed by Organizer to Registarz under this TOS or otherwise, Registarz may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, (i) deduct such amounts from Organizer's outstanding balance, whether for that particular event or for any other event that Organizer lists through the Services; and/or (ii) send an invoice to Organizer for such amounts to the extent Organizer's outstanding balance is insufficient to cover these costs, in which case Organizer shall pay Registarz such invoiced amounts within thirty (30) days after the date of the invoice. If payment for any amounts due to Registarz hereunder are not made by Organizer when due, Registarz reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without limiting its other rights and remedies, to terminate Organizer's registration for the Services (including any and all accounts that Organizer may have) and to cancel all other events listed by Organizer.</p>
							<p>(b) Confirmation.</p>
							<p>Upon receipt of a credit card authorization from each individual ticket purchase, Registarz generates a confirmation message and issues a unique confirmation number. You agree to unconditionally accept, honor, and fulfill all ticketing commitments that have been confirmed by Registarz through the Services, and it is your responsibility to verify the Buyer's membership status, confirmation number and/or any event restrictions prior to the subject event.</p>
							<p>(c) Taxes; Withholding.</p>
							<p>(i) You are solely responsible for determining which, if any, sales, use, amusement, value added, consumption, excise and other taxes, duties, levies and charges (collectively, "Taxes") apply to your use of the Services and you agree that it is your sole responsibility to, and that you will, collect, remit and report the correct amounts of all such Taxes to the applicable governmental authorities, even if Registarz provides you with tax tools or tax calculators that assist you in doing so. Registarz does not represent, warrant or guarantee that any tax tools or tax calculators provided to you will meet all tax requirements that may be applicable to you or that such tax tools or tax calculators will result in your collection or remittance of all applicable Taxes, which Taxes may vary based on the nature of your event, the nature of your tax status (individual, entity, business, consumer, etc.), your location, the location of your Attendees, credits and deductions for which you may qualify and other factors, and you hereby release Registarz of any and all liability with respect to your use of the tax tools and/or tax calculators. None of such tax tools or tax calculators should be considered legal or tax advice. If you do collect Taxes on the Services, those Taxes will be treated like Event Registration Fees and Registarz will pay such amounts to you at the same time as the underlying Event Registration Fees. If you use any tax tools or tax calculators that require you to input a tax registration number, you represent and warrant that such tax registration number is true and correct. Registarz cannot give you legal or tax advice, so please be sure to check with your own tax advisor about any applicable Taxes. In the event that a governmental authority requires Registarz to pay any Taxes attributable to your use of the Services, you agree to promptly and fully reimburse Registarz for such Taxes upon demand and all costs, penalties, interest and expenses related thereto.</p>
							<p>(ii) All Fees charged by Registarz do not include any Taxes except to the extent that a Tax is expressly set forth in the applicable invoice or billing statement, and you agree to pay any Taxes that are imposed and payable on such Fees (other than those calculated based on Registarz 's net income) to Registarz. If you are outside of the United States, you may be required to self-assess certain indirect Taxes on our Fees (or certain portions of our Fees) under the applicable reverse charge procedure on your indirect tax returns. To the extent you are required to self-assess, Registarz will use reasonable efforts to note that on your invoices.</p>
							<p>(iii) In addition, due to IRS regulations, if Registarz processes transactions and issues you payouts (A) for more than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) in gross sales; and (B) for more than two hundred (200) transaction orders, in each case during a given calendar year and in the aggregate across all of your accounts, Registarz is required to report to the IRS (i) the gross amount of transactions for which you have been paid in that calendar year and in each month of that calendar year; (ii) your name; (iii) your address; and (iv) your Tax Identification Number ("Your Tax Information"). As part of these IRS regulations, Registarz is required to either (A) collect Your Tax Information; or (B) establish that you are a foreign person not subject to US taxes, before your accounts pass the two hundred (200) order transaction threshold in the aggregate. Once your accounts cross the two hundred (200) order transaction threshold, you agree that you will not receive any further payments from Registarz until either (A) or (B) above are satisfied.</p>
							<p>(iv) Registarz reserves the right to withhold the payment of any amounts owed to you hereunder if Registarz believes in its discretion that it is required to do so by applicable local, state, provincial, national or other law, rule, regulation, judgment or order.</p>
							<p>5. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS.</p>

You agree to (a) immediately notify Registarz of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. Registarz cannot and will not be liable for any loss, damage or other liability arising from your failure to comply with this Section or from any unauthorized access to or use of your account. In the event of any dispute between two or more parties as to account ownership, you agree that Registarz shall be the sole arbiter of such dispute in its sole discretion and that Registarz'S decision (which may include termination or suspension of any account subject to dispute) shall be final and binding on all parties.</p>
							<p>7. CONTENT.</p>

In addition, by accepting a particular Card Scheme payment type (e.g., Mastercard, Visa, American Express), you are authorizing the owner of that Card Scheme and its affiliates to use your name, address and website URL in any media from time to time.</p>
							<p><b>7.3 DMCA.</b></p>

If you believe in good faith that any Content made available in connection with the Services infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the Content be removed, or access to it blocked. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright">http://www.loc.gov/copyright</a>&nbsp;for details). </p>
